Assignment 4
November 2018

Running the program: 
	
	Compile using command "make"
	Insert your data file (must be named "A4_data_f18.txt")
	Run using command ./avltree
	
	All outputs are identical to those laid out in the assignment handout.


Sourcing:
	
	Some parts of this code, specifically rotations of nodes for balancing the tree were
	sourced from github.com. I also used two algorithms from stackoverflow.com for bugchecking.
	Those functions are for printing in postorder and inorder and are not used in the assignment.
